# UAV STRUCTURE 
## Requirements:
1. VTOL
2. Forward flight 

## UAV design for the above requirements
* For hovering - helicoptors, multirotors, ducted fans - optimal choice
* Endurance - fixed wing - good cruising 

## General Overview 
* Transition between hovering and level flight is of primary concern for VTOL. 
* Proposed paper has a good design that includes 1 propeller for forward flight and 4 propellers for VTOL. 
* Forward Propulsion System: the thrust from the propeller balances the drag due to fuselage; wing provides lift; ailerons, rudder and elevator control roll, pitch and yaw. 
* VTOL propulsion system: 4 propellers for VTOL and roll, pitch and yaw in VTOL is achieved by changing propeller thrusts ie. controlling their speeds.
